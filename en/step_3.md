## Cress Egg Heads

Plants grow far too slowly for you to see it happening. However, there's a trick that you can use to speed up time and watch them sprout!

If a photo is taken every minute, for instance, the photos can be stitched together into a movie or a GIF and the time between frames reduced to a fraction of a second. This is what we call a time-lapse film.

You're going to use the technique of time-lapse photography to watch cress growing on some egg heads. The only trouble is you need to let the time pass and capture the images along the way. This is where the Raspberry Pi comes in, but first you'll need to make some cress egg heads!
