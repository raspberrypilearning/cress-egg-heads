## What is a time-lapse?

Plants grow far too slowly for you to see it happening. However, there's a trick that you can use to speed up time and watch them sprout!

If a photo is taken every minute, for instance, the photos can be stitched together into a movie or a GIF and the time between frames reduced to a fraction of a second. This is what we call a **time-lapse film**.
