## Setting up for a time-lapse

Before you start time-lapse recording the cress egg heads, there are several things you should consider. 

#### Location

This needs to be somewhere warm with sunlight where the cress and the camera can be left **undisturbed** for a whole week; a classroom windowsill might not be ideal. Even slight movements will be noticeable in the final cut.

#### Lighting
Having an electric light source on the cress egg heads will allow growth to be recorded at night, and will make for a nicer end result. Without this setup, the recording will switch abruptly between light and darkness.

#### Storage sapce
If you run out of free space on your Raspberry Pi's SD card mid way through the week, some footage will be lost. You can set the size of the photographs so that they don't take up too much space.
